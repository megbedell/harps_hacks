# **HARPS hacks**



**harps\_hacks** is a python package for deriving precise radial velocity measurements from HARPS observations. It also contains some useful tools for reading and manipulating the output data products of the HARPS pipeline. This code is still very much a work in progress, but see [docs/summary.txt](docs/summary.txt) for a semi-complete summary of what we've implemented so far!
